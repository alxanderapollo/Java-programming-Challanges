		 * so first the logic statement checks the word and compares it to stop
		 *  if it is equal to the word stop, the flag is set to false and a terminating sentence goes into effect
		 * 
		 * the else: statement runs when a word or sentence  that is not STOP or stop isn't entered.
		 * the flag is of the type boolean,  and when created set to true so that it may enter the while loop.
		 * 
		 * while loop: in the while loop, the input is checked for the letters, and the accumulators , accumulate  according to the findings 
		 * when all the letters have been accounted for a gui window displays results, and the accumulators are set to zero
		 * the program then prompts the user, and another validation check is done in the if statement
		 * if the word is equal to stop, a break is set in, otherwise the counting of letters is done once more.
